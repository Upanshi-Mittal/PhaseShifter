# ⚡ PhaseShifter — The 3D Shape Lab

**PhaseShifter** is an interactive 3D playground where shapes bend, twist, morph, and shift before your eyes.  
Powered by **Three.js**, **React**, **GSAP**, and **lil-gui**, it’s your own browser-based shape-shifting laboratory.  
Spin it. Morph it. Recolor it. Phase-shift it. 🔮
